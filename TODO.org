* DONE modeline update still not enough

1. [X] create/delete frames

2. [X] ESC quit

* DONE modeline segments should always display real buffer

1. [X] segment color? (esc save file doesn't update color)

2. [X] switch frame doesn't update (only happens when echo area shows something, like direnv)
